EverythingCostsEXP | XP Economy | Pay for Commands & Actions | Confirmation System | GUI Menu

Tagline:
Turn Experience Levels into a valuable currency! Charge XP for commands, block interactions, crafting, and more with a robust confirmation system.

Description:

EverythingCostsEXP transforms the way players value their Experience Levels. Instead of just using XP for enchanting, make it the core currency of your server!

With this plugin, you can charge players XP levels for executing commands, breaking or placing specific blocks, crafting items, and performing various actions like fishing or breeding. It comes with a smart Confirmation System to ensure players know exactly what they are spending.

=== Key Features ===

* XP as Currency: Deduct XP levels for almost any interaction.
* Command Costs: Charge for powerful commands like /home, /tp, /fly, etc.
* Action Costs:
    * Breaking specific blocks (e.g., Diamond Ore).
    * Placing specific blocks (e.g., TNT).
    * Crafting specific items (e.g., Diamond Sword).
    * Enchanting, Fishing, Breeding, Taming, and Teleporting.
* Smart Confirmation System:
    * ONCE: Ask for confirmation only the first time a player pays for an action (User Friendly!).
    * ALWAYS: Require confirmation every single time.
    * NEVER: Instant deduction for fast-paced servers.
* In-Game Menu: Players can type /xpmenu to see a beautiful Book GUI listing all current costs.
* Visual Feedback: Configurable Action Bar messages, Titles, and Sound effects when paying.
* Fully Configurable: Customize every cost, message, and setting in config.yml and messages.yml.
